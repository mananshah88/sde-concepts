SOA: Service Oriented Architecture
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communiprotocol over a network.

- Microservices are a modern interpretation of service-oriented architectures used to build distributed software systems. 
- Services in a microservice architecture are processes that communicate with each other over the network in order to fulfill a goal.
